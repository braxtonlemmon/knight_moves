Data structure project based on The Odin Project's computer science curriculum

This program shows the shortest path for a knight on a chessboard to get from one square to another.
The program is utilized by running the function knight_moves(start, end).
The user enters the x,y coordinates of the starting square and the ending square. 

Example: 

			knight_moves([0,0], [3,4])

	The program will then output the shortest path:
			You reached your spot in 3 moves! Here is your path:
			[0, 0]
			[2, 1]
			[1, 3]
			[3, 4]
